## Gee Bee Game Rules
Some special designs:
* A buttom called "A larger ball" is displayed and users can click it to change to a bigger ball and wider paddles.
Once the "Big Ball" buttun clicked, a function called bigBall() will be called to change the ballRadius and paddleWidth.
* Notice: A larger ball is only used to help people with poor eye-sight, not to make the game easier.
*
* Users may choose the slow speed pattern and spend longer time to earn enough credits so I designed different time limit for different
speed. Users do not need to worry about time issue when choosing speed.They can even choose not to set up the timer and enjoy a relaxing game. 
* Corresponding to speed chosen, the time limit will be shown on screen and the related variable, second,will be put in setInterval() method to set timer.
